    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Tender, flavorful, and crazy moist Italian Baked Chicken. This recipe is one of my favourites and is family-friendly, cost-efficient, super easy, and quick to throw together,<br> plus this is healthier than fried! Try adding some spices to the mayo mixture as I did such as thyme, rosemary, oregano, and dried parsley.<br> Prep this in under ten minutes with simple ingredients and you’ll have this on your dinner table in no time!
